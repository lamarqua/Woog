TODO.txt
- investigate proper loading of javascript files / external resources
> according to my research the best way is to just do what we do!

- at some point think of a way to structure the whole thing
still relevant, but we can keep adding stuff for now

- Ideas for stuff to implement:
 * polyphony
 * custom oscillator waveforms
	 * investigate why changing frequency on oscillator changes so slowly while listening
	 -> apparently ppl recommend creating an oscillator for every note
 * adding LFO effects: tremolo, vibrato, etc
