TODO.txt
- Ideas for stuff to implement:
 * custom oscillator waveforms
	 * investigate why changing frequency on oscillator changes so slowly while listening
	 -> apparently ppl recommend creating an oscillator for every note
 	* MOOG has square, sawtooth, triangle, square-ish with short and long duty cycles,
 * adding LFO effects: tremolo, vibrato, etc
 * basic global filter
 * adding back reverb w/ dry/wet control
 * having several oscillators per waveform including white noise / pink noise
 * allowing to switch between reverbs by pressing pad
 * restructure ADSR code to allow reuse by per voice filter
 * per voice filter with ADSR control
 * ADSR implement exponential curves instead of linear
 * implement some kind of nice sounding analog / tube distortion
 * implement different kind of priorities and voice allocations
 	* fixing note killing to handle edge case
 * having basic interface to show values
 * visualization with built FFT stuff
 * see if we can read MIDI files?
 * BitCrushing


 * handle case where we want to disable LFO
 *


- Architecture and code
 * investigate Flow
 * architecture: create higher level objects such as Envelopes, ReverbNodeWithMix, MultiOscillator, etc... And how for example LFO node and Envelope node would have the same interface
 * investigate user interface
 * knob switching / better utilization


 - Reading
  * Flow docs
  * Minimoog architecture / general synth architecture / vocabulary
  * Natural distoriton
