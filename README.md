# Woog

Woog (tentative name) is a software synthesizer written as a pair programming project by Taylor Burgess (@tayloraburgess) and Adrien Lamarque (lamarqua) at the Recurse Center.
It currently requires a MIDI synthesizer and a recent browser that supports WebAudio.

Polyphonic with four voices, 1 oscillator per voice, and voice allocation (lowest note voice stealing). Convolution reverb (any IR !), low pass filter, full ADSR volume envelope, tremolo and basic bitcrushing.
